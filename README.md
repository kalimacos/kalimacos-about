# kalimacos-about

kalimacos (kali-macOS) is an attempt to port the kali tools on macOS.
I basically have 0 experience with kali (have never even installed it on my computer),
but I am positive that this port process will go quite nicely and will attract even
more people! (probably more experienced!)

This way, this amateur project may one day gain that amount of attention that will help
it flourish into a full-fledged kali-macOS distro.
